sir before reading the code please watch the basic video that i gave you i.e. php in 40 mins and mysql in 40 mins.

after you have watched the video,read the following:

the only things i have used apart from the video are..
1. redirecting the user:
    in the file tools.php i have declared a function load()
     see redirecting the user to another page is pretty easy except the fact that u have to generate a valid url of the page u want the user to redirect to, u have to take care of the slashes "/"     eg. the url u want to redirect is "www.khalsa.com/admission/ug/2017" now u see there are many slashes so u have to trim all the extra slashes and finally  ADD THE header() FUNCTION WHICH IS USED TO REDIRECT THE USER
 
it takes a parameter Location which contains the url of the page.write it as
  header("Location:$url");

the file connect_db.php is used to establish the connection to the database and we include the file as require('connect_db.php')
always remember that the database connection file should be kept outside the htdocs file to prevent any unauthorisez attempt to access your database.In that case we write require('../connect_db.php');

now this is to notice that there are two ways to access other php files in your directory.
one is as I told you through require()
the other is include"file name")

now when to use include and when to use require?

when u just want to access the functions of that file use require but if u want the whole content of the file to be displayed on your webpage use include eg instead of making header for every file i just made one header.html file and include() it in every file to save effort and time.


for further documentation follow these steps:
 1 go to index.php
 2 go to connect_db.php
 3 go to all.php
 4 go to new_challan.php
 5 go to add.php
